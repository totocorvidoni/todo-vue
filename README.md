# Thou shall do

![Set your goal. Achive Them. Pat yoruself on the back.](https://totocorvidoni.github.io/todo-vue/cover.png)

Made in response of an [assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/todo-list) for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

Switch easily between the app's two modes. A simplified view which manage todos quickly and a full view mode that features in-depth todo management.
